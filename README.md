This repo implements a simple Rust image processing library. The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of the Rust programming language. 

Currently implemented image information features:
- Calculate brightness of an image
- Calculate blur score based on the laplacian variance of the image

Currently implemented image transformation features:
- Get and save the negative version of an image
